# Roadmap

## Short-Term

Bug fixes. 

## Long-Term

I've heard horror stories about raw system calls in C++. Maybe find an alternative? I'm googling.

Nix the terminal prompt, find a way to do a dmenu or rofi style GUI prompt.

## Ongoing

Keep the program light. The current program is 23 KiB, let's keep it like that.
