# Evan's Basic Runmenu

More suckless than dmenu!

## Why?

This is a beginner project I have been working on while I've been learning C++. 

I think it's pretty neat, it runs inside of a terminal but can run any software from any directory.

It's barebones, but I will return to it over time. Pretty neat!

## Installation

You can use a makefile!

`make && make install`

You can also manually compile with g++.

I use `g++ runmenu.cpp -o runmenu`.

If you want, you can cleanup the files after install.

`make clean`
